# Code for FasteR

This is a repository related to [fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) (a basic R language tutorial). The files in the repository are: 

- [fasteR.ipynb](https://github.com/LeetaH666/code4fasteR/blob/master/fasteR.ipynb): the Jupyter notebook based on the tutorial;
    - If you are already a programmer, then you can just read and run the notebook to get familiar with coding with R without reading the tutorial; but if you are a nonprogrammer, it would be better to read the [fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) tutorial simultaneously.
- [external_file.R](https://github.com/LeetaH666/code4fasteR/blob/master/external_file.R): an R file that would be used in [fasteR.ipynb](https://github.com/LeetaH666/code4fasteR/blob/master/fasteR.ipynb);
- [r_problem.md](https://github.com/LeetaH666/code4fasteR/blob/master/r_problem.md): a markdown that recording some problems I have met when using R in VSCode, including how to install R in VSCode, how to deal with LSP error, how to remove those annoying linters, how to use R in Jupyter, why outputs in Jupyter are wierd, etc.
    - The contents are written using Chinese, but if someone requests me to give a English version, I may update it.

The code in [fasteR.ipynb](https://github.com/LeetaH666/code4fasteR/blob/master/fasteR.ipynb) is slightly different from that in [fasteR](https://github.com/matloff/fasteR) because I met some problems when running the original code. I have optimized the code to make it can run appropriately.

Now there are only contents for PART I and that is enough for me. But if someone wants to learn PART II, I may update it.
